# My Projects
Welcome to my coding playground! This repo showcases my journey as an AI & Data Engineer, blending AI, data science, and software engineering. From forecasting Swiss housing prices to building LLM-powered tools, these projects highlight my skills in Python, cloud systems, and beyond. Get in touch with me on LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerkleinbauer/).

## Projects

### 1. Swiss Housing Market Price Prediction
*Forecasting housing trends with ML.*  
- Built a time-series pipeline integrating Swiss National Bank (SNB), World Bank, and FSO data.  
- Developed models (Lasso, PCA, interpolation to come) to predict prices, ultimately targeting a deployable API.  
- Will create custom visualizations for market insights.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, requests  
**Status**: In progress—aiming for live deployment by April 2025.

### 2. RAG Chatbot
*LLM-driven chatbot to provide contextual responses to queries.*  
- Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4, deployed via Streamlit.  
- Handles complex queries to provide detailed information about Argusa using multiple retrieval methods.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, Streamlit, FAISS, BM25
**Status**: Complete—[Live Demo](https://ask-questions-about-argusa.streamlit.app/).

### 3. Web Scraping with LLM Summarization
*Automated content extraction system.*  
- Engineered a Dockerized bot on Snowflake to scrape data, summarize with LLMs, and post to Slack daily.  
- Reduced insight delivery time from hours to minutes for internal team updates.
**Tech Stack**: Python, Selenium, Docker, Slack API, LLM APIs  
**Status**: Complete—deployed on Snowflake.

### 4. Speaker Diarization System
*Audio analysis for speaker identification.*  
- Integrated Hugging Face’s Pyannote.audio to segment multi-speaker audio, achieving ~90% accuracy on test data.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Pyannote.audio, Hugging Face, pandas  
**Status**: Complete—open-source contribution.

### 5. Django React Demo
*Full-stack music controller app.*  
- Developed a RESTful app with Django backend and React/Material-UI frontend.  
**Tech Stack**: Django, React, Material-UI, JavaScript  
**Status**: Complete—demo project.

### 6. Matplotlib Animations
*Educational statistical visualizations.*  
- Animated concepts like Gradient Descent and Central Limit Theorem.  
**Tech Stack**: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy  
**Status**: Complete—learning tool.

### Bonus: Job Application AI Agent
*Separate repo—my moonshot!*  
- Building an LLM-powered coach for CVs, cover letters, and interview prep.
