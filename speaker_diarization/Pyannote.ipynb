      "TranscriptionVerbose(duration=963.22998046875, language='french', text=\"Je vais vous donner des premières informations. C'est parti, donc... Pour information, Enzo est le leader de votre groupe. Vous allez pouvoir commencer dans un instant, je vais juste préparer le crédit. On a combien de temps ? 15 minutes. Alors, c'est parti, maintenant. En gros, je pense que le mieux, c'est de faire des triangles pour monter. Parce qu'en gros, j'avais un cours de structure. On a vu que les formes les plus résistantes, c'est les triangles. Genre, en triangle, c'est plus résistant. Et au bout, ça permettrait d'avoir un triangle qui tient le marshmallow. Genre, une tour, je pense, c'est tendu à faire. Alors que si on fait des triangles... Après, la question que je me pose, c'est... Vu qu'on n'a pas beaucoup de spaghettis, est-ce que c'est mieux de faire des triangles complets ? Ou des triangles de demi-spaghettis ? Moi, je me disais déjà, la base, je crois qu'il faudrait peut-être commencer avec les complets. Et ensuite, quand on monte plus haut, on peut les couper. Mais est-ce qu'on part sur une base triangulaire, du coup ? Ou en carré ? Triangulaire. Et après, on va passer sur des triangles sur des carrés. Parce que les triangles, ça se combine bien, parfaitement. Donc là, c'est ça, c'est un triangle. Et après, du coup, vous montez un triangle. Avec quoi, du coup ? Avec la visette. Mais on est d'accord, du coup, le marshmallow, il faut le mettre tout, tout, tout. Oui, oui, mais du coup, en haut... On ne peut pas le mettre au milieu. Et on ne peut pas utiliser le marshmallow. Il faut une sauce. Tout au sol. Parce qu'à la fin, tu vois un truc comme ça, et en mode, vu que les spaghettis sont super fins, genre, ça va se casser parce que c'est super lourd, ça. Alors que là, trois trucs, genre, on a vu en cours, c'est super résistant. Donc, voilà. Le dernier, c'est impossible de le... Tu vois, du coup... Non, ça casse. Ça casse quel ? Ça casse. Ça n'a jamais ça. Si, c'est vrai. À part toute la ficelle, c'est tendu à gérer, genre... Oui, parce qu'attacher des spaghettis avec des ficelles... Là, on a le scotch. Ah, il y a du scotch ! C'est plus facile que la ficelle. Je ne sais pas à quoi elle sert la ficelle. Peut-être qu'elle sert à... Double truc, en fait. En tout cas, le scotch, ça va bien... Tu mets la ficelle, tu essaies de la mettre autour et tu mets le scotch, oui, mais... La ficelle, ça va être galère à... Mais la base, on peut juste la scotcher, je pense, sur... La scotcher sur la table, ça serait bon. Oui, c'est pas mal. Vas-y, tenez, si vous voulez. Ouais, vas-y. Après, peut-être, si on fait un des triangles comme ça, on pourra faire un autre triangle. Peut-être pas en moitié, déjà, mais peut-être en tiers. Ensuite, on... On va voir. Parce que moi, je croyais qu'il en allait plus. Putain, on est déjà à 2 minutes 30. On va pouvoir l'activer. Ouais. Tu mets le scotch... Ouais, ouais. On peut l'utiliser sur l'angle ou... Sur l'angle, ouais. En vrai, je pense que lui-même, il mettait un vrai bout de scotch. N'hésitez pas. En vrai, on en a beaucoup, là, du scotch pour l'utilisation que... On peut l'utiliser sur l'angle. On peut l'utiliser sur l'angle, ouais. On peut l'utiliser sur l'angle, ouais. On peut l'utiliser sur l'angle, ouais. L'utilisation que... Putain. En vrai, on a mal commencé, je pense. Comment on va attacher cela ? Ouais, mais je crois que je me dis que... Genre, à part... Ouais, ouais, ouais. Je peux le mettre dans l'angle. Je peux le mettre dans l'angle. Je me dis, mais... On le met là, et après, on remet un bout de scotch. Ouais, je pense que ça passe. Est-ce que ça sert vraiment d'avoir une base ? Ouais, ouais, ouais, ouais. Ouais. Parce que si on l'applique... En fait, ça va éviter que ça... Ouais. On peut l'appliquer sur l'extérieur ? Ok. Allez. Putain, c'est pas possible. Ok. Vas-y, ça me parait bien. Voilà, ça s'embrouille pas normalement. Surtout sur l'extérieur, il faut que ça soit bien collé. Ouais. Pour que ça porte. Et du coup, après... Comme ça, ça... Ouais. Je pense qu'on arrive même à faire un petit trou, tu sais. Tu sais ce que je veux dire. Après, mettre ces deux-là ensemble, et faire ça... Ouais, genre ça doit se relancer comme ça, avec un troisième, là. Et avec un gros scotch en haut. Ouais. Et après, comment on fait pour remonter ? En fait, je fais un deuxième triangle. En fait, il faut faire trois triangles. Faire un deuxième triangle, là. Comme un château de cartes ? Comme un château de cartes, ouais. Ah, ok. Mais du coup, pour activer, genre... Là, mets un bon bout de scotch, là. T'en fais toi, jusque là. Oups. Attaches le bout des trois, là, en haut. Putain. Attention, parce que si t'attaches trop bas, ça va casser, après. Ah, ouais, ok. J'avais pas compris que c'était pour ça. T'es sûr que tu veux pas que je re... Ouais. Ouais. Ouais, on va le refaire. Du coup, après, tu peux faire... En fait, il faut se servir de la picelle, je pense. La picelle, à quel moment ? Je sais pas, mais pour les maintenir, genre... Après, une fois que t'as fait ça, tu veux quoi faire ? Une autre base à côté ? Bah, vous avez de meilleures idées, sinon, parce que... Mais on peut pas faire plutôt comme ça, et on monte, et on fait une base au-dessus, et on monte... Vas-y, si tu veux, on essaie ça, vas-y. Je sais pas, hein, enfin... Ouais, ouais, on peut essayer ça, hein. Mais c'est juste que, comme ça, je vois pas comment ils tiennent, genre, tout droit. Alors, après, on remet une base de... Ils vont pas... Ouais, ouais, ouais. En fait, c'est quoi ? On peut monter une deuxième base régulière, pour ensuite venir la poser, du coup, à l'étage bleu ? Oui. On peut faire ça. Je suis pas sûre si ça va vraiment. On a pas énormément de temps. Ouais, mais c'est pour ça que je pensais d'aller en carré, parce qu'après, tu veux faire des triangles de support, dans le carré. Vas-y. Et monter, comme ça, là. Bah, si tu veux, on peut. On peut faire un carré ? Allez, on a tout fait. Mais c'est... Allez, on fait ça. Ok. On enlève le scotch, on ré-en... Ah, ouais, non, c'est bon. Ok. Ça, ils en ont beaucoup, hein. On peut réutiliser ça. Parce qu'après, là, si on fait des trucs... Comme ça, on peut les ramener au centre et refaire un autre. On peut essayer de faire une base comme ça. Après, c'est difficile avec les matériaux qu'on a, mais bon. Tu veux monter comme ça, du coup ? Ouais. Tu veux monter comme ça, du coup ? Ouais. Tu veux monter comme ça, du coup ? Comme ça, tu voulais. Non ? Comme ça. Ou... On va essayer de faire comme ça. Ou comme ça, carrément. Je sais pas. Je sais pas ce qui tient mieux. Moi non plus. Parce qu'après, si on fait comme ça, ça revient à la même chose que les triangles. Si on les ramène tous au centre. On fait comme ça, on fait un carré, on refait comme ça, on monte par étage. Du coup, je vais essayer d'en casser 4 pour faire un carré plus petit. Il faut commencer à s'activer. Par contre, là, pour l'instant, je pense pas qu'on va pouvoir les coller comme ça. Non, mais là, si on fait le carré là, on peut mettre le carré... Ouais, on va tenir en haut et les coller là. Je pense qu'il faut d'abord coller le carré en dessous et après venir mettre ça. Tiens. Ouais, si on pose ça. Du coup, ce qu'on fait là, c'est qu'on forme le carré. Ensuite, on vient le casser au bout de ces 4 là, parce qu'ils sont un peu plus petits. N'hésitez pas. Sur le scotch, en gros, on en a beaucoup. Moi, ce que je me pose comme question, c'est comment on peut utiliser le carré ? Là, on fait un carré. OK. Attends, on va le faire de là et après on l'enlève et... OK, voilà. Et on tourne le scotch autour. Je vais essayer de pas trop coller à la table, du coup. Ouais. Le spaghetti, il se laisse décoller quand on enlève le scotch. Ouais. Normalement. Et là, finalement, on peut glisser pour faire quoi ? Parce que c'est bien là pour une raison. Ou peut-être que c'est justement là pour nous faire chier. Merde. OK. Maintenant, on va essayer... Il faut qu'on décolle des... Décolle juste le... OK. En fait, ça m'est trop con. On aurait dû mettre le scotch en dessous. Ouais, c'est ce que j'essayais de faire avant, mais j'arrivais pas à le faire tenir. Donc, j'utilise le décolle de mon doigt. Voilà. C'est un carré approximatif. C'est un raisin de chocolat. Ça rentre bien, là, dans le... Voilà. Donc là, on essaie juste de trouver un moyen pour les coller. C'est ce qu'on peut faire. On peut déjà scotcher quatre spaghettis à chaque angle, là. Putain, mais le scotch tire pas, en fait. Oui, c'est ça. 25 minutes. Il va rester au sol, c'est vachement gros. On a déjà été par l'air. Il y a pas un moyen d'attacher ça. Bon, là, on devrait à peu près... A peu près ? Ouais, je pense que ça va... Maintenant, j'ai cassé ton truc. Attends, attends. Putain, arrête-toi, putain, c'est un délice. C'est pas un truc... C'est pas un truc, c'est un délice. C'est un délice. C'est un délice. C'est un délice. C'est un délice. C'est un délice. C'est un délice. Un ficeau, ça m'a l'air pas mal, quand même, en fait. Tu fait des petits noeuds comme ça. Pour tenir. Ça m'a l'air bien solide. Non, c'est pas mal, là. Bon, au pire, on n'est pas obligés d'en mettre à chaque bout, ou si on met entre deux pour vraiment... Ouais, si on prend... Il nous reste 4 minutes 30, là, pour pouvoir bombarder. OK, en gros, on se met 2 à tenir le bas... On se met 2 à tenir le bas. Il en faut un qui scotche et un qui tient le haut. Ouais, c'est ça. Il veut scotcher, lui, il scotche. J'ai fait des petits trucs, là, déjà, sur le bord. Ouais, avec la ficelle, tu le sens mieux, mais je sais pas... Je vais tenter la ficelle. Est-ce que ça prend trop de temps d'essayer de faire des... Attends, attends, attends, mais en fait, après l'erreur... Si on fait... Putain, merde. Avec le temps qu'on a, on peut poser des spaghettis en travers. Parce qu'on n'a pas le temps pour faire encore un niveau, et après, on pose dessus, et on espère que ça tient. Mais si on fait un trou dans le scotch ? On fait comment ? Avec le scotch, là, avec le... Et tu vois, tu viens passer juste le spaghetti dedans. Parce que ça prendra moins de temps que d'essayer de faire ça. Attention, attention, attention ! Faut pas plier le... Ouais, mais si tu prends le petit, qui est déjà cassé, tu vas casser le spaghetti, en fait. Oh, putain. Putain, j'ai tiré. Ouais. C'est catastrophique, j'ai dû faire une fence, déjà. Pour qu'il puisse arriver vers le... Vers l'enveloppe. Il te reste un bout de scotch ? Non, mais si tu fais ça, après, ça va pas... Ça va pas tenir, en fait. Il reste trois minutes. Trois minutes ? Ouais. Pour les boeufs, il faut mettre déjà des spaghettis dans le marshmallow, comme ça, au pire des cas, on a déjà un truc qui fait... 15 centimètres. C'est ce que je vais déjà faire. Parce que si on arrive à monter ça, on peut juste le poser de travers, comme ça. C'est ça, exactement. Le scotch, il tient pas, ça me rend... Non, ça m'en fout. Tiens. Et là, si on te colle un scotch par-dessus toi... Faut choper un autre bout. Tu dis moi, là ? Ouais. Ouais, justement, moi, je crois que... Le mien, on peut le coller à l'angle, là. Je sais pas où il est. Après, il va couper un autre bout de scotch, je sais pas. Oui, tiens. Merci. Je te tiens. Il nous reste deux minutes, il faut tenter un truc. Allez. Il faut qu'il me pisse, ensuite. Tu peux pas couper un bout du marshmallow pour l'épluser ? Ça, ça marcherait bien. C'est en entier ? Ouais, c'est en entier. En fait, je sais pas pourquoi, en se léchant, c'est plus... En plein dans l'angle, donc c'est plus compliqué. Tu entends ce que je veux dire ? Ça, c'est impossible. Ça me rend fou. Après, si on arrive à juste le poser... Putain. Oh, la vraie galère. Oui. On a 10 minutes. 1 minute 30. Merci. Voilà. Comme ça, il y a un peu d'attention, aussi. Je sais pas si ça casse pas. Il faudrait maintenir en plus. Il nous reste une minute. Il nous reste une minute. Comment on mettra là ? Je ferais la même chose ici. Je manque ça. Je fais comme ça, comme ça, c'est pas en train de coller, mais si... Quand j'attache en haut, ça met la tension dessus, ça casse. Ça va jamais tenir. 30 secondes. Ok, merde. Ok. Il faut... Oh, parfait. Il nous reste 15 secondes. Ouais. Voilà, 10 secondes. Putain de merde. Ça va tellement pas tenir. C'est fini. C'est fini, lâchez. Ça va. Futur ingénieur. C'est trop galère, il colle pas le scotch. Il colle pas pour tous les gros. Ouais. Mais oui. Du coup, est-ce que vous pouvez juste répéter votre prénom, votre numéro de cabine ? Liam, 1. Enzo, 2. Anne, 3. Nathalia, 4. Parfait.

      "Je vais vous donner des premières informations. C'est parti, donc... Pour information, Enzo est le leader de votre groupe. Vous allez pouvoir commencer dans un instant, je vais juste préparer le crédit. On a combien de temps ? 15 minutes. Alors, c'est parti, maintenant. Donc en gros, moi je pense que le mieux c'est de faire des triangles pour monter. Parce qu'en gros, moi j'avais un cours de structure, on a vu que les formes les plus résistantes c'est des triangles. Genre en triangle c'est plus résistant, et au bout ça permettrait d'avoir un triangle qui tient le marshmallow. Genre une tour je pense c'est tendu à faire quoi. Alors que si on fait des triangles... Après la question que je me pose c'est, vu qu'on a pas beaucoup de spaghettis, est-ce que c'est mieux de faire des triangles complets ? Ou des triangles de demi-spaghettis ? Moi je me disais déjà, la base, je crois qu'il faudrait peut-être commencer avec les complets, et ensuite quand on monte plus haut on peut les couper. Mais est-ce qu'on part sur une base triangulaire du coup, ou en carré ? Triangulaire, parce que les triangles ça se combine bien parfaitement. Donc là c'est ça, c'est un triangle, et après du coup vous montez un triangle. Avec quoi du coup ? Avec la ficelle. On est d'accord du coup le marshmallow il faut l'avoir tout, tout, tout. Oui oui, mais du coup en haut... On peut pas le mettre au milieu. On peut pas utiliser le marshmallow. Il faut une sauce. Parce qu'à la fin tu vois un truc comme ça, et en mode vu que les spaghettis sont super fins, genre ça va se casser parce que c'est super lourd ça. Alors que là, trois trucs, genre on a vu en cours c'est super résistant. Le dernier c'est impossible de le... Tu vois du coup... Non ça casse, ça casse. Ça va jamais s'arrêter. A part toute la ficelle ça va être tendu à jouer. Oui parce qu'attacher des spaghettis avec des ficelles... Là on a le scotch. Ah il y a du scotch ! C'est plus facile que la ficelle. Je sais pas pourquoi je sors la ficelle. Peut-être que c'est vrai. C'est rare. Double truc en fait. En tout cas le scotch ça va bien... Tu mets la ficelle, t'essayes de la mettre autour et tu mets le scotch. La ficelle ça va être galère. Mais la base on peut juste la scotcher je pense. Le scotcher sur la table ça serait bon. Vas-y, tenez si vous voulez. Vas-y. Après peut-être si on fait un des triangles comme ça on pourra faire un autre triangle. Peut-être pas en moitié déjà, peut-être en tiers. Ensuite on diminue. Parce que moi je croyais qu'il en allait plus. Putain on est déjà à 2 minutes 30, il va falloir l'activer. Tu mets le scotch... Sur l'angle ? Sur l'angle, ouais. En vrai je pense que tu peux mettre un vrai bout de scotch. N'hésitez pas. En vrai on a beaucoup du scotch pour l'utilisation. En vrai on a mal commencé je pense. Comment on va attacher ceux-là ? Genre à part... Je vais le mettre dans l'angle. On le met là et après on remet un bout de scotch. Je pense que ça passe. Ouais, ouais, ouais. Parce qu'après ça va éviter que ça glisse de l'extérieur. Allez. Putain, c'est pas possible. Ok. A mon avis ça me parait bien. Voilà ça s'embrasse pas normalement. Surtout sur l'extérieur, il faut que ça soit bien collé.  Pour que ça porte. Et du coup après, comme ça c'est ça. Ouais. Je pense qu'on arrive même à faire un petit trou, tu sais. Tu sais ce que je veux dire. Après mettre ces deux-là ensemble et faire ça. Ouais, genre ça doit se relancer comme ça avec un troisième là.  Et après comment ? Et après comment pour remonter ? En fait je fais un deuxième triangle. En fait il faut faire trois triangles. Faire un deuxième triangle là. Comme un château de cartes ? Ouais, comme un château de cartes, ouais. Ah, ok. Mais du coup faut activer, genre... Là met un bon bout de scotch là. T'en fais toi parce que... Oups. Attache le bout des trois là en haut. Putain. Attention parce que si t'attaches trop bas ça va casser après. Ah ouais, ok. J'avais pas compris que c'était pour ça. T'es sûr que tu veux pas que je re... Ouais. Ouais. Ouais c'est bon. Ouais on va le refaire. Du coup après tu peux faire... Après faut se servir de la picelle je pense. La picelle à quel moment ? Je sais pas mais pour les maintenir genre... Après une fois que t'as fait ça tu veux quoi ? Faire une autre base à côté ? Ouais, triangle. Bah vous avez de meilleures idées sinon parce que... Mais on peut pas faire plutôt comme ça et on monte et on fait une base au-dessus et on monte... Vas-y si tu veux on essaye ça vas-y. Je sais pas hein, enfin... Ouais ouais on peut essayer ça hein. Mais c'est juste que comme ça je vois pas comment ils tiennent genre tout droit. Alors après on remet une base... Je sais pas. On peut monter une deuxième base régulière pour ensuite venir la poser du coup à l'étage bleu ? Oui. On peut faire ça. Je suis pas sûre si ça va vraiment. On a pas énormément de temps. Ouais mais c'est pour ça que je pensais aller en carré. Parce qu'après tu veux faire des triangles de support dans le carré. Vas-y. Et monter comme ça là. Si vous voulez on peut faire comme là comme... On peut faire un carré ? On a tout fait. Mais c'est... Tant mieux. Allez on fait ça. On enlève le scotch on va... Ah ouais non c'est bon. Ok. C'est une bonne idée. On peut réutiliser ça. Parce qu'après là si on fait des trucs... Comme ça on peut les ramener au centre et refaire un autre. Essayer de faire une base comme ça. Après c'est difficile avec les matériaux qu'on a mais bon. Voilà. Tu veux monter comme ça du coup ? Comme ça tu voulais ? Non ? Comme ça ou... On va essayer de faire comme ça. Ou comme ça carrément. Je sais pas. Je sais pas ce qui tient mieux. Moi non plus. Parce qu'après si on fait comme ça ça revient à la même chose que les triangles. Si on les ramène tous au centre. On fait comme ça. On fait un carré. On refait comme ça. On monte par étage. Du coup je vais essayer d'en casser 4 pour faire un carré plus petit.  Parce que c'est bien la même taille. Voilà il faut commencer à s'activer. On n'est plus gaiement à moitié. Par contre là pour l'instant je pense pas qu'on va pouvoir les poser comme ça. Non mais là si on fait le carré là on peut mettre le carré et les tenir en haut. Je pense qu'il faut d'abord coller le carré en dessous et après venir mettre ça. Du coup ce qu'on fait là c'est qu'on forme le carré. Ensuite on vient le casser au bout de ces 4 là parce qu'ils sont un peu plus petits du coup.  Sur le scotch en bas on en a beaucoup. Moi ce que je me pose comme question c'est comment on peut utiliser ça. En fin de compte c'est un peu plus difficile. Attends faut le faire de là et après on l'enlève et on tourne le scotch autour. Je vais essayer de pas trop coller à la table du coup. Le spaghetti il se laisse décoller quand on enlève le scotch en fait. Ouais. Normalement. Et là finalement on peut le laisser pour faire quoi ? Parce que c'est bien là pour une raison. Ou peut-être que c'est justement là pour nous faire chier. Ok. Maintenant on va essayer. Faut qu'on décolle. En fait ça va être trop court on aurait dû mettre le scotch en dessous. Ouais c'est ce que j'essayais de faire avant mais j'arrivais pas à le faire tenir. Donc je décolle de mon doigt. Donc voilà. C'est un carré approximatif. C'est un raison parce que ça rentre bien là dans le...  Donc là on essaie juste de trouver un moyen pour les coller.  Je sais pas ce qu'on peut faire. On peut déjà scotcher quatre spaghettis à chaque angle là. Putain mais le scotch il tire pas en fait. Oui c'est ça. 25 minutes. Il va rester au sol ce match vraiment. On va le jeter par l'air. Tiens. J'ai pas moyen d'attacher ça. Bon là on devrait à peu près... A peu près ? Ouais je pensais avoir... Maintenant j'ai cassé ton truc. Attends. Arrête toi putain. La ficelle ça m'a l'air pas mal quand même en fait. Tu fais des petits nœuds comme ça. Pour tenir. Ça m'a l'air bien solide. Bon au pire on est pas obligé d'en mettre à chaque bout si on met entre deux pour vraiment... Si on prend... Il nous reste 4 minutes 30 avant de pouvoir bombarder. En gros on se met deux à tenir le bas. Il en faut un qui scotche et un qui tient le haut. Ouais c'est ça. J'ai fait des petits trucs là déjà sur le bord. Avec la ficelle ça se sent mieux mais je sais pas. Je vais tenter la ficelle. Est-ce que ça prend trop de temps d'essayer de faire des... Attends mais en fait... Avec le temps qu'on a on peut poser des spaghettis en travers. Parce qu'on a pas le temps pour faire encore un niveau et après on pose dessus et on espère que ça tient. Mais si on fait un trou dans le scotch ? On fait comment ? Juste là avec... Et tu vois tu viens passer juste le spaghetti dedans. Parce que ça prendra moins de temps que d'essayer de faire ça. Attention, attention. Faut pas plier le... Ouais mais si tu prends le petit qui est déjà cassé. Là tu vas casser le spaghetti en fait. Oh putain. Et t'as le petit. C'est catastrophique. On va juste faire une fence déjà. Pour qu'il puisse arriver vers l'ombre. Il te reste un bout de scotch ? Ouais mais si tu fais ça après ça va pas... Ça va pas tenir en fait. Trois minutes. Trois minutes ? Ouais. Pour les boeufs il faut mettre déjà des spaghettis dans le marshmallow comme ça au pire des cas on a déjà un truc qui fait 15 centimètres. Ce que je vais déjà faire. Parce que si on arrive à monter ça on peut juste le poser de travers comme ça. C'est ça exactement. Le scotch il tient pas ça me ronde dans. Ça m'en fous. Tiens. Et là si on te prend un scotch par dessus toi. Faut choper un autre bout. Tu dis moi là ? Ouais. Ouais justement moi je crois que le mien il est un peu collé à l'angle là. Après on va couper un autre bout de scotch. Ouais tiens. Je te tiens. Oh putain voilà. Il nous reste deux minutes il faut tenter un truc. Aïe. Tu peux pas couper un bout du marshmallow pour l'utiliser ? C'est en entier ? Ouais c'est en entier. En fait je sais pas pourquoi on séchait aussi les clous en plein dans l'angle. C'est plus compliqué. Tu entends ce que je veux dire ? Ça c'est impossible. Ça m'en fous. Après si on arrive à juste le poser. Voilà. Oh la vraie galère. On a 10 minutes. 10 minutes 30. Merci. Voilà. Comme ça il y a un peu d'attention aussi. J'espère que ça casse pas. Il faudra maintenir en plus. Aïe il nous reste une minute là. Il faut vraiment mettre ça là. On va faire la même chose ici. Je manque ça. Comme ça c'est pas en train de coller. Quand j'attache en haut ça met l'attention dessus et ça passe. Ça va jamais tenir. 30 secondes. Ok. Il faut... Il nous reste 15 secondes. Voilà 10 secondes. Ça va tellement pas tenir. C'est fini. C'est fini.  Ça va. Futur ingénieur. C'est trop galère. Il colle pas le scotch. Il colle pas pour tous les gros. Ouais. Mais oui. Du coup est-ce que vous illustrez bien votre prénom, votre numéro de cabine ? Liam 1, Enzo 2 et Ben 3. Nathalia 4. Parfait. Vous pouvez répondre aux dernières questions et ensuite je vais vous payer. Merci.\n"
